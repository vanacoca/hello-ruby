# EXERCISE
# Given the following Ruby hash that represents weather data,
# write a weather summary out to the screen. Something like this:

# Currently it is 67 degrees and sunny. Tomorrow it will be 65 and Mostly Cloudy.
# The next day it we will see Partly Cloudy skies, with a temperature of 70.

# HINT
# String interpolation is a fancy term for "we don't have
# to add strings together using the plus sign anymore"
# number_of_tacos = 5
# "I would like #{number_of_tacos} tacos, please"
# No more worrying about converting numbers to strings!
